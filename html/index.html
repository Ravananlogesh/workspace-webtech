     <p style="font-size: 26px; ">Adolf Hitler was an Austrian-born German politician who was the dictator of Germany from 1933 until his suicide in 1945. He rose to power as the leader of the Nazi Party, becoming the chancellor in 1933 and then taking the title of Führer und Reichskanzler in 1934. <br></p>
     <center><h1 style="color: #383838;">Early life</h1></center>
       <p style="font-size: 22px; color: blue;">After his father’s retirement from the state customs service, Adolf Hitler spent most of his childhood in Linz, the capital of Upper Austria. It remained his favourite city throughout his life, and he expressed his wish to be buried there. Alois Hitler died in 1903 but left an adequate pension and savings to support his wife and children. Although Hitler feared and disliked his father, he was a devoted son to his mother, who died after much suffering in 1907.</p>
       <p style="font-size: 21px;">With a mixed record as a student, Hitler never advanced beyond a secondary education. After leaving school, he visited Vienna, then returned to Linz, where he dreamed of becoming an artist. Later, he used the small allowance he continued to draw to maintain himself in Vienna. He wished to study art, for which he had some faculties, but he twice failed to secure entry to the Academy of Fine Arts. For some years he lived a lonely and isolated life, earning a precarious livelihood by painting postcards and advertisements and drifting from one municipal hostel to another. Hitler already showed traits that characterized his later life: loneliness and secretiveness, a bohemian mode of everyday existence, and hatred of cosmopolitanism and of the multinational character of Vienna.

        In 1913 Hitler moved to Munich. Screened for Austrian military service in February 1914, he was classified as unfit because of inadequate physical vigour; but when World War I broke out, he petitioned Bavarian King Louis III to be allowed to serve, and one day after submitting that request, he was notified that he would be permitted to join the 16th Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment. After some eight weeks of training, Hitler was deployed in October 1914 to Belgium, where he participated in the First Battle of Ypres. He served throughout the war, was wounded in October 1916, and was gassed two years later near Ypres. He was hospitalized when the conflict ended. During the war, he was continuously in the front line as a headquarters runner; his bravery in action was rewarded with the Iron Cross, Second Class, in December 1914, and the Iron Cross, First Class (a rare decoration for a corporal), in August 1918. He greeted the war with enthusiasm, as a great relief from the frustration and aimlessness of civilian life. He found discipline and comradeship satisfying and was confirmed in his belief in the heroic virtues of war.</p>

            <b>In September 1931, his half-niece, Geli Raubal, took her own life with Hitler's gun in his Munich apartment.</b> It was rumoured among contemporaries that Geli was in a romantic relationship with him, and her death was a source of deep, lasting pain.Paula Hitler, the younger sister of Hitler and the last living member of his immediate family, died in June 1960.
            Hitler was born to a practising Catholic mother and an anti-clerical father; after leaving home, Hitler never again attended Mass or received the sacraments. Albert Speer states that Hitler railed against the church to his political associates, and though he never officially left the church, he had no attachment to it. He adds that Hitler felt that in the absence of organised religion, people would turn to mysticism, which he considered regressive.According to Speer, Hitler believed that Japanese religious beliefs or Islam would have been a more suitable religion for Germans than Christianity, with its "meekness and flabbiness". Historian John S. Conway states that Hitler was fundamentally opposed to the Christian churches.According to Bullock, Hitler did not believe in God, was anticlerical, and held Christian ethics in contempt because they contravened his preferred view of "survival of the fittest". He favoured aspects of Protestantism that suited his own views, and adopted some elements of the Catholic Church's hierarchical organisation, liturgy, and phraseology. In a 1932 speech, Hitler stated that he was not a Catholic, and declared himself a German Christian. In a conversation with Albert Speer, Hitler said, "Through me the Evangelical Church could become the established church, as in England."

            <p  style="font-size: 22px;">Hitler shaking hands with Bishop Ludwig Müller in Germany in the 1930sHitler viewed the church as an important politically conservative influence on society, and he adopted a strategic relationship with it that "suited his immediate political purposes".In public, Hitler often praised Christian heritage and German Christian culture, though professing a belief in an "Aryan Jesus" who fought against the Jews. Any pro-Christian public rhetoric contradicted his private statements, which described Christianity as "absurdity" and nonsense founded on lies.
                According to a US Office of Strategic Services report, "The Nazi Master Plan", Hitler planned to destroy the influence of Christian churches within the Reich. His eventual goal was the total elimination of Christianity. This goal informed Hitler's movement early on, but he saw it as inexpedient to publicly express this extreme position. According to Bullock, Hitler wanted to wait until after the war before executing this plan.
                Speer wrote that Hitler had a negative view of Himmler's and Alfred Rosenberg's mystical notions and Himmler's attempt to mythologise the SS. Hitler was more pragmatic, and his ambitions centred on more practical concerns.

            Hitler joined the German Workers' Party (DAP) and soon became its leader. In 1920, the party was renamed the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), or the Nazi Party. Hitler's oratory skills and propaganda machine helped him rise to power.

       <p style="font-size: 22px;"><b style="color: #383838;">World War II,</b> one of the most devastating conflicts in human history, was orchestrated by Adolf Hitler, the infamous dictator of Nazi Germany. Hitler's rise to power and his aggressive expansionist policies set the stage for a conflict that would engulf the world in violence and suffering. This article delves into the life of Adolf Hitler, the factors that led to World War II, and the catastrophic consequences of his actions. 
<br><br>
        <b>Adolf Hitler's Early Life and Rise to Power:</b><br><br>
        Adolf Hitler was born in Austria in 1889. His early years were marked by struggles and hardships, but he eventually joined the German Workers' Party, which later became the National Socialist German Workers' Party <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Nazi-Party" target="_blank">(Nazi Party)</a>. In 1933, Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany, effectively giving him control of the government. His authoritarian rule and propaganda machine promoted an aggressive expansionist agenda.

       <h2 style="color: #383838;">Expansionism and Aggression:</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 21px;">
            One of Hitler's main goals was the expansion of German territory and influence. His aggressive foreign policies included the reoccupation of the Rhineland, the annexation of Austria (Anschluss), and the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. However, it was his invasion of Poland in September 1939 that ignited World War II. This prompted Britain and France to declare war on Germany, marking the beginning of a global conflict.<br>

           <b style="color: #383838;"> The Holocaust and Atrocities:</b><br>
           <br>
            Adolf Hitler's regime is notorious for its horrendous crimes against humanity. The Holocaust, the systematic genocide of six million Jews and millions of other innocent victims, remains a dark stain on human history. Concentration camps, mass shootings, and forced labor were employed to perpetrate these atrocities. <br>
            <br>
            <b style="color: #383838;"> The Global Impact:</b><br>
            <br>
            World War II, which raged from 1939 to 1945, resulted in millions of casualties, both military and civilian. Cities were reduced to rubble, and the war disrupted the lives of countless individuals and families. The conflict reshaped the world order, leading to the emergence of the United States and the Soviet Union as superpowers and the establishment of the United Nations to prevent future global conflicts. <br>

            <b style="color: #383838;">The Downfall of Hitler and Nazi Germany:</b><br>
            <br>
            As the war turned against Nazi Germany, Hitler's grip on power began to slip. In 1945, with the Allied forces closing in on Berlin, Hitler committed suicide in his bunker. A few days later, Germany surrendered unconditionally, bringing an end to the war in Europe.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 25px; line-height: 39px ;"><b><em>On 30 April 1945,</em> </b>Hitler and his wife Eva Braun committed suicide. On the previous day, Hitler had dictated his will to his secretary. In it, he praised the struggle of the German people and blamed the Jews for the war.

             The rest of the will specified who was to be his successor. <b style="color: brown;"> When Hitler committed suicide, he had been hiding in the 'Führerbunker' in the centre of Berlin for more than three months.</b> In this underground shelter, he and the people around him had heard how the Soviet Union army was getting closer and closer. During his last days, no one could go outside because of the incoming shells. It was clear that Germany had finally lost the war. After his death, SS officers carried Hitler and his wife out of the bunker. Their bodies were drenched in gasoline and set on fire. The next day, the news of <b style="color: red;"><strike>Hitler's death</strike></b> was announced on the radio. The wording suggested that <u>Hitler had died</u> a heroic death defending the capital of the German Empire.
